Generative AI is reshaping how banks serve customers and empower employees. In this case, ING partnered with McKinsey & Company to embed generative AI into its operations with a clear goal: enhance human productivity while improving customer experience.

ING recognized that traditional automation and analytics tools were reaching maturity. To create the next wave of impact, the bank focused on generative AI applications across customer support, internal knowledge management, compliance documentation, and relationship management workflows.

The transformation began with identifying high-impact use cases where generative AI could reduce manual effort while maintaining regulatory rigor. AI copilots were deployed to assist customer service representatives with real-time response drafting, summarize complex documentation, and provide contextual knowledge retrieval.

In parallel, generative AI tools were introduced to accelerate software development, compliance review, and internal reporting processes. These tools reduced repetitive work, improved consistency, and enhanced turnaround times.

The implementation followed a controlled governance model to ensure regulatory compliance, data security, and explainability. ING combined agile experimentation with structured risk management to scale safely.

Impact metrics from early deployments included:

• 20–30 percent reduction in average customer handling time
• 25 percent productivity improvement in selected back-office functions
• 15–20 percent faster document and compliance review cycles
• Significant reduction in repetitive knowledge-search tasks
• Higher employee satisfaction scores due to reduced administrative burden

This case highlights how generative AI can act as a human-enablement tool rather than a replacement strategy. ING’s approach demonstrates that when AI is embedded responsibly, it strengthens both operational efficiency and customer-centric banking.
